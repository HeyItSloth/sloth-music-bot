# Sloth Music Bot

Welcome to the very messy github for the Sloth Music Bot. If you're here, you're desperate. Don't expect support, or anything useful, this is my learning project, mostly for personal use. It's only public so I don't have to mess with FTP or SFTP stuff on my VPS.

## config.json

In the main directory for the bot, create a config.json and fill it in with the below. This bot only works on a per-server basis, currently, not global. Deal with it.

```json
{
    "token":    "",
    "clientId": "",
    "guildId":  ""
}
```
